# Just One Cookbook

## Description

A guide through an authentic Japanese recipe site. In this activity I've learned how to use a hyperlink to link my webpage to another, as well as how to emphasize text using the strong element.

> _**HTML &lt;a&gt; Tag**_  
>
> _**Definition and Usage**_  
> _The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another._  
> _The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination._  
> _By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:_
> * _An unvisited link is underlined and blue_
> * _A visited link is underlined and purple_
> * _An active link is underlined and red_
>
> _**Tips and Notes**_  
> _**Tip:** If the &lt;a&gt; tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink._  
> _**Tip:** A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target._  
> _**Tip:** Use CSS to style links: CSS Links and CSS Buttons._ - [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp "HTML <a> Tag")
